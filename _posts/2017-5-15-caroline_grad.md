Congratulations to the first alum from the group, Caroline Holmes!
Caroline received her honors BS in Physics in May, and is headed to Princeton for grad school. 
She's a star -- co-first author on a [groundbreaking paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/5/1171.abstract) and a [McMullan Award winner](http://news.emory.edu/stories/2017/05/er_commencement_mcmullan_holmes/campus.html). 
Look for more from her soon!
