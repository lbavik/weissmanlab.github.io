Daniel has been named a [Simons Investigator in the Mathematical Modeling of Living Systems](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/mathematics-physical-sciences/simons-investigators/simons-investigators-awardees/#chapter-2017)! This means we have more money to hire postdocs with, so please get in touch if you're interested.
