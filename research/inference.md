summary: "What can we learn about populations from their genomes?"
---

In order to predict how populations will evolve in the future, we need to know how they are evolving right now.
The rapid advance of genetic sequencing technology is creating the potential to do this on an unprecedented scale,
but we need to figure out what sequences we need and how to interpret them. 
Doing so will require new analytical tools that ask questions that are only now becoming answerable.
We are working on a method to learn the patterns of ancestry in a population from genomic samples
using only minimal assumptions.
