summary: "How do associations among alleles affect evolution?"
---

Alleles at one gene are generally associated with alleles at many other genes 
(i.e., individuals carrying allele _A_ of gene 1 are more likely to carry allele _B_ of gene 2 than individuals carrying _a_).
These associations arise because of [functional interactions among genes](/research/complex.html),
[population subdivision](/research/space.html), and simply as a necessary consequence of finite population size.
One particularly important form is when beneficial alleles are negatively associated with each other,
interfering with selection for each other.
How strong is this effect in natural populations, and how can we [detect](/research/inference.html) it? 
How much recombination is needed to break down interference?
